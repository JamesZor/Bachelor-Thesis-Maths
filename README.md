## Abstract
The presence of travelling waves on the surface of starfish oocytes and other cellular systems
during cytokinesis has sparked interest in understanding their precise dynamics. This study
aims to address this knowledge gap by investigating the behaviour of a reaction-diffusion model
and exploring its parameter space to reveal bifurcation points and the emergence of travelling
waves by numerical methods. The findings have the potential to enhance our understanding of
cortical excitability and provide valuable insights into the self-organising patterns and dynamic
behaviour exhibited by cells.
In this study, we employ a reaction-diffusion model to simulate the spatiotemporal dynamics
of the cell cortex during cytokinesis. By varying the model parameters, we systematically explore
the parameter space to identify regions where travelling waves arise. The numerical methods
utilised allow for the efficient computation and visualisation of the evolving wave patterns.
